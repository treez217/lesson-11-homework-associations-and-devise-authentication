Be sure to provide your child with the full historical context surrounding racism, beginning with American slavery and ending with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They’ll value your honesty. Both “I don’t know” and “Christ, I said I don’t know, Taylor!” are perfectly valid answers to their questions. Invite a Chinese stranger to your home and have your children sit next to them on the couch until they feel at ease. Repeat for all other races. Remind kids it’s okay to notice ethnicity as long as you avoid talking about it until you get in the car. Don’t forget to unconsciously impart all of your racial biases during the discussion. Go ahead and slip in some admonitions in favor of safe sex and responsible driving if the opportunity arises. If your child is upset or uncomfortable, rest assured that you’ve conveyed the situation to them fully and accurately.", "author_id"=>"1", "tag_ids"=>["8", "9", ""]}, "commit"=>"Update Article", "id"=>"15"}
